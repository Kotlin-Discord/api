# API Client

This project contains a light API client wrapper for making use of the API at
[our site](https://kotlindiscord.com). It also provides a set of dataclasses which are
used to define the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API - which allows
us to keep everything in one place.

We'll update this README again when we have some documentation to show you.
